HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION SYSTEM
A Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on property features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking. This project uses Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit to create a simple interactive app for local use.

FEATURES
Predicts house prices using a trained Linear Regression model
Simple and easy-to-use Streamlit interface
Uses 5 numeric inputs for prediction
Runs entirely on localhost â€” no deployment needed

WORKING
Training
Loads the dataset (Housing.csv)
Uses Linear Regression with data scaling
Saves the trained model as a .pkl file

PREDICTION
User enters details (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking)
The app scales inputs and predicts the price
Displays result instantly
